**Introduction**
Welcome to my first machine learning project! The primary objective of this project is to predict prices using machine learning techniques. I have conducted a basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset and implemented three different models. The goal is to compare these models and determine the best-performing one for price prediction.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
I began by thoroughly exploring the dataset to gain a deeper understanding of its characteristics. This involved:

Analyzing data distributions
Identifying outliers
Handling missing values
Visualizing key trends
EDA played a crucial role in informing subsequent modeling decisions and ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the data.

**Model Comparison**
For this project, I implemented three machine learning models:

LinearRegression
DecisionTreeRegressor
RandomForestRegressor

Each model was chosen based on its suitability for the task and its potential to capture the underlying patterns in the data. I trained and evaluated each model, comparing their performance metrics and assessing how well they predicted prices.

**Results**
After a rigorous comparison, RandomForestRegressor emerged as the most accurate in predicting prices. The performance metrics, such as the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) after Cross-Validation, indicated its superior capability in capturing the underlying patterns in the dataset. This model is selected as the final choice for price prediction in this project.

**#Future Steps**
As this is my first machine learning project, there is always room for improvement. In the future, I plan to:

Explore additional feature engineering techniques
Experiment with more advanced models
Further optimize the selected model to enhance its predictive accuracy

**Conclusion**
In conclusion, this project marks my initiation into the field of machine learning. Through EDA and model comparison, I have gained valuable insights into the dataset and identified a robust model for predicting prices. This experience serves as a foundation for future projects and continuous learning in the exciting realm of machine learning.
